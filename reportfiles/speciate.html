			<h5>Pollutants dropped due to double counting</h5>
			<p>When there is a general species group (like VOCs) that is speciated into specific chemicals, but some of the specific chemicals are also tracked in the inventory, there is a possibility for double counting. So for records that include both the general species group and specific data for some of its components, the specific components that are explicitly included in the inventory are dropped from the speciation of the general group.</p>
