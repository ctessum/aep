#DELIMITED
# date of imported file is Oct 05 2006
# Add 10 PFC SCCs on April 16, 2007
# re-added the 10 PFC SCCs on May 1 2007 because they were added to the wrong version on April 16.  Also changed some SCC defns --- last tier -- to be consistent with Ron's new master list (from undefined to general)
# On October 3and4, June 1 2006 version of this file was modified to add the six SCCs in ptfire:  26100005F0 28100010F0, 28100010S0, 28100150F0, 28100150F1 and  28100200F0
# On October 4   2810050F0 was added per Rich Mason email of an SCC change
# On October 5 28100050F0 was fixed (from total to flaming)and so was 2810005000 (from flaming to total). Also, 26100005F0 was removed (see 10/03/06 email from strum to ryan)

#REV_HISTORY 09/25/2008 Madeleine Strum.    What:  onroad SCCs for start emissions (parking areas)    Why:  parking area onroad SCCs are present in onroad sectors for which MOVES was used to estimate emissions
#REV_HISTORY 12/12/2008 Madeleine Strum.    What:  added 3 ethanol production related storage/transport sccs    Why:  these sccs are introduced in the 2022 inventories for rfs (nonpt sector)
#REV_HISTORY 12/19/2008 Allan Beidler.    What:  added SCC for 2002v2 ptnonipm    Why:  not included
#REV_HISTORY 12/19/2008 Allan Beidler.    What:  new descriptions	    Why:  for ptnonipmv2
#REV_HISTORY 12/19/2008 Allan Beidler.    What:  added two SCCs     Why:  for 2005v2 ptnonipm
#REV_HISTORY 02/03/2009 Rich Mason.    What:  added 19 WRAP oil and gas SCCs    Why:  O3 designations modeling
#REV_HISTORY 02/17/2009 Allan Beidler.    What:  added 5 new SCCs	    Why:  new for Canada 2006
#REV_HISTORY 11/20/2009 Rich Mason.    What:  added diesel (22300X) start/idle SCCs 350 and 370    Why:  moves for ldghg
#REV_HISTORY 11/20/2009 Rich Mason.    What:  removed duplicate SCCs from diesel starts    Why:  because Rich got sloppy adding new records for LDGHG diesel start SCCs
#REV_HISTORY 02/26/2010 Madeleine Strum.    What:  added two new EVENT  SCCs - prescribed and Open Fire    Why:  New SCCs are in 2007 ptfire file
#REV_HISTORY 04/06/2010 Allan Beidler.    What:  Descriptions for MC parking    Why:  new in 2007 on_noadj
